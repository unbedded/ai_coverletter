Hiring Committee<br>
DeepX<br>
RE: Robotics System Integration Engineer

Engineering Manager who led collision detection system field deployment across 6-van pilot fleet, tuned perception performance 8→15fps (87.5% improvement) by optimizing ROS2 node graph, CAN decoding, and telemetry feedback loops [1]. This real-world autonomous vehicle deployment experience directly aligns with DeepX's heavy machinery autonomous solutions integration challenges.

With over 20 years of systems integration experience, including extensive collaboration with Japanese engineering teams, I am excited to contribute to DeepX's mission of advancing autonomous solutions for heavy machinery through robust software-hardware integration and field-tested reliability.

**ROS2 Development and Hardware Integration Experience**
- Led development of Linux-based 3D perception collision alert system using ROS2 framework for autonomous delivery van fleet deployment, managing sensor integration with FLASH LiDAR and implementing cloud connectivity via AWS [1]
- Managed 20×20m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell with 6-degree-of-freedom arm on OTTO-100 AMR base, utilizing LQR controller with OptiTrack vision feedback for precision servo control and repeatable trajectory delivery
- Built scalable ingestion services processing multi-sensor incident data with containerized Docker services using event-driven ROS architecture, working cross-functionally with QA and product managers in agile environments
- Successfully integrated hardware components including NVIDIA GPUs, 5G networking, and real-time telemetry systems with robust field deployment validation

**Systems Engineering and Field Testing Leadership**
- Applied formal V-model systems engineering processes across multiple manufacturing workcells from requirements elicitation through TÜV certification and field trials, managing 25-engineer development team to achieve market leadership position
- Led comprehensive FMEA analysis, verification matrices, and requirements traceability through testing, delivering systems capable of processing 1M+ devices per hour with real-time processing capabilities
- Generated 9 patents filed with 6 issued, including keystone patent US6706999B1 for laser drilling system, demonstrating deep technical innovation in complex system integration [4]
- Coordinated closely with marketing and customer base to develop product roadmaps, balancing project constraints, customer requirements, and market trends

**Software Development and Low-Level Programming**
- Developed over 20+ years multi-language programming expertise in C++, Python, and embedded C with comprehensive experience in version control systems, code review processes, and CMake build systems
- Implemented embedded C real-time software for consumer products using ARM32 and Arduino controllers, created IDL auto-generator for CLI and Python interfaces enabling Protobuf serial communication with embedded targets
- Extended networking capabilities to support gRPC with BLE and TCP/IP bidirectional streaming, demonstrating proficiency in socket communications and low-level infrastructure development
- Authored comprehensive technical documentation including white papers on automation frameworks, product requirements, and BLE security protocols

**CAN Bus Communication and Automotive Protocols**
- Achieved 87.5% performance improvement in autonomous vehicle perception systems by optimizing ROS2 node graphs and CAN decoding algorithms for real-time telemetry processing [1]
- Developed expertise in automotive communication protocols including DBC file handling, PTP time synchronization, UDP messaging, and SOME/IP integration using Python tooling
- Successfully deployed field-tested systems in pilot vehicle fleets with robust CAN bus integration and real-time monitoring capabilities

I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to DeepX's autonomous heavy machinery solutions, leveraging my experience in ROS2 development, field testing validation, and systems integration. My proven track record in managing complex robotics deployments and cross-cultural collaboration positions me well to enhance the robustness and field-readiness of your autonomous solutions.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
