Hiring Committee
Software Integration Engineer, Driverless e-Palette
Woven by Toyota

RE: Software Integration Engineer, Driverless e-Palette

I am excited to apply for the Software Integration Engineer position for the Driverless e-Palette at Woven by Toyota. With over 20 years of systems integration experience spanning autonomous driving systems, real-time robotics, and comprehensive software-hardware integration, I am uniquely positioned to contribute to your mission of achieving "Mobility for All" through reliable driverless operations.

I am eager to support Woven by Toyota's transformative vision and commitment to zero accidents and enhanced well-being for all. With over 20 years of experience working both in-country and remotely with Japanese engineering teams, I bring advanced systems integration expertise, strong cross-cultural communication skills, and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

**System Integration in Autonomous Driving and Real-Time Robotics**
- Led development of Linux-based 3D perception collision alert system integrating FLASH LiDAR sensors, NVIDIA GPUs, and ROS framework achieving 3D perception up to 10 meters range for autonomous vehicle fleet deployment [1]
- Managed integration and operation of 20×20m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell for SLAM device testing, coordinating embedded systems, perception software, and 6-degree-of-freedom manipulation hardware
- Served as lead architect evaluating LiDAR performance for AEB-VRU systems against Euro NCAP protocols, achieving successful VRU detection within 8 meters across all test scenarios including pedestrian/cyclist detection
- Integrated multiple sensors over Ethernet using UDP and IP protocols for real-time perception systems, including GPS data integration for geotagging motion-triggered events in ADAS validation

**Software-Hardware Integration and Performance Optimization**
- Developed comprehensive integration plans for manufacturing workcells spanning embedded C real-time software, ARM32 and Arduino controllers, and complex mechanical actuator systems
- Created custom Interface Definition Language (IDL) that auto-generated APIs, embedded command-line interpreters, and host-side Python interfaces with bidirectional gRPC streaming over TCP/IP and wireless BLE adaptors [2]
- Implemented distributed real-time control system enabling massive throughput scaling from 150k/hr to 1,000k/hr (566% improvement) through advanced software-hardware integration and performance optimization
- Designed intelligent I/O solution offloading real-time tasks from Windows PC with extensible architecture, addressing complex performance trade-offs in real-time systems

**Statistical Analysis and System Performance Evaluation**
- Developed Python-based diagnostic toolchain consolidating logs from multiple subsystems, implementing statistical analysis with KPI graphing and process flowcharting, reducing diagnostic time from days to hours
- Created laser calibration software integrating R-Project statistical package for galvo field distortion correction, implementing comprehensive statistical analysis for precision manufacturing systems
- Led 25-engineer team developing MLCC testing platform generating $30M+ in sales, implementing advanced statistical analysis and visualization for real-time processing of over 1 million devices per hour
- Established comprehensive testing procedures ensuring system stability, functionality, and performance through statistical evaluation methodologies and automated result analysis

**Automotive Protocols and Modern Development Methodologies**
- Integrated high-speed CAN bus signals including speed, braking, and steering data for ADAS validation systems, demonstrating deep knowledge of automotive communication protocols
- Established Agile workflows decomposing Jira epics into testable tasks paired with unit tests, standardizing code review processes, branching strategies, and artifact versioning using modern development tools
- Implemented containerized development environments using Docker with Git-based version control and automated CI/CD pipelines for production software delivery
- Successfully delivered multiple manufacturing workcells from requirements through TÜV certification and field trials using formal V-model systems engineering process with comprehensive integration validation

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Woven by Toyota's driverless e-Palette program, leveraging my extensive experience in autonomous vehicle systems integration, real-time performance optimization, and cross-cultural collaboration. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with Woven's mission to transform mobility through human-centric innovation.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
