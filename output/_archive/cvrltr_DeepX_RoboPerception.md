RE: Robotics Software Engineer (Perception)

I am excited to apply for the Robotics Software Engineer (Perception) role at DeepX. With extensive experience in LiDAR perception systems, computer vision development, and ROS-based robotics integration, I am uniquely positioned to advance your autonomous robotics perception capabilities and drive performance optimization of your perception algorithms.

I am eager to support DeepX's mission to deliver advanced autonomous robotics systems. With over 20 years of experience working both in-country and remotely with Japanese engineering teams, I bring perception expertise, strong cross-cultural communication skills, and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

**LiDAR and Point Cloud Processing**
- Led development of Linux-based 3D perception collision alert system using FLASH LiDAR sensor integration, achieving 3D perception up to 10 meters range for autonomous vehicle deployment with real-time point cloud processing
- Designed and implemented OpenGL-based point cloud visualization techniques for LiDAR sensor viewer with real-time rendering capabilities for 3D sensor data analysis and debugging

**Computer Vision and Classical Perception Algorithms**
- Developed novel IR irradiance sensor using machine vision with C++/OpenCV for 15+ years, improving manufacturing accuracy by 30% through vision-based alignment and closed-loop feedback systems
- Created vision-based target alignment system with advanced algorithms, optical sensors, and lighting integration for high-precision manufacturing applications

**ROS Integration and Deep Learning Frameworks**
- Managed integration and operation of 20×20m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell for SLAM device testing with precision trajectory control and 6-degree-of-freedom manipulation
- Leveraged AI for system-level diagnostic toolchain development, including Python-based log processing with unit tests and automated analysis reducing diagnostic time from days to hours

**Autonomous Vehicle Industry Experience**
- Served as lead architect evaluating LiDAR performance for AEB-VRU systems against Euro NCAP protocols, achieving successful VRU detection within 8 meters across all test scenarios
- Integrated GPS data and high-speed CAN bus signals including speed, braking, and steering data for ADAS validation with multiple sensors over Ethernet using UDP protocols

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to DeepX's autonomous robotics perception systems, leveraging my experience in LiDAR processing, computer vision algorithms, and real-world perception validation. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with DeepX's mission to deliver robust autonomous solutions.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
