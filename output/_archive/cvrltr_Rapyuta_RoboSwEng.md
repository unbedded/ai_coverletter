RE: Software Engineer - Robotics Control Systems

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer - Robotics Control Systems role at Rapyuta Robotics. With extensive experience in distributed control systems, multi-robot coordination, and C++ development for robotics applications, I am uniquely positioned to drive innovation in your multi-robot control systems and contribute to your open-source ALICA framework.

I am eager to support Rapyuta Robotics' mission to advance autonomous robotics solutions. With over 20 years of experience working both in-country and remotely with Japanese engineering teams, I bring distributed systems expertise, strong cross-cultural communication skills, and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

**Distributed Control Systems and Multi-Robot Coordination**
- Proposed and designed distributed real-time control system enabling massive throughput scaling for next-generation MLCC testers, scaling from 150k/hr to 1,000k/hr (566% improvement) through scalable architecture design
- Managed integration and operation of 20×20m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell for SLAM device testing with precision trajectory control and 6-degree-of-freedom manipulation coordination

**Algorithm Design and C++ Development**
- Developed production-grade C++ software using modern C++17 features with CMake build systems, comprehensive unit and integration testing frameworks, and containerized deployment
- Contributed to C++ machine vision projects for target alignment and closed-loop feedback systems over 15+ years, improving manufacturing accuracy by 30% through advanced algorithms and precision control

**Path Planning and Task Allocation**
- Led 25-engineer team developing MLCC testing platform generating $30M+ in sales, coordinating multiple stages and actuators through intelligent task allocation and real-time processing optimization
- Created digital servo controller extending probe life 2x beyond competition using C on floating-point DSP with advanced control algorithms and multi-threading implementation

**ROS and Distributed Intelligence Systems**
- Led development of Linux-based 3D perception collision alert system using ROS framework with FLASH LiDAR sensor integration and real-time data processing across distributed cloud infrastructure
- Built scalable ingestion services processing multi-sensor data leveraging message queues, blob storage, and distributed cloud infrastructure with event-driven ROS architecture

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Rapyuta Robotics' multi-robot control systems, leveraging my experience in distributed control algorithms, C++ development, and autonomous robotics coordination. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with Rapyuta's mission to deliver innovative robotics solutions.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
