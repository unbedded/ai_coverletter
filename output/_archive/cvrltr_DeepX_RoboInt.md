Hiring Committee
Robotics System Integration Engineer
DeepX

RE: Robotics System Integration Engineer

I am excited to apply for the Robotics System Integration Engineer role at DeepX. With over 20 years of robotics and systems integration experience, including ROS2 development, real-world field testing, and comprehensive hardware/software integration, I am uniquely qualified to enhance the robustness and field-readiness of your autonomous heavy machinery solutions.

I am eager to support DeepX's mission to deliver autonomous solutions for heavy machinery. With over 20 years of experience working both in-country and remotely with Japanese engineering teams, I bring integration expertise, strong cross-cultural communication skills, and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

**ROS2 Development and Integration**
- Led development of Linux-based 3D perception collision alert system using ROS framework with FLASH LiDAR sensor integration, achieving 3D perception up to 10 meters range for delivery van fleet deployment
- Managed integration and operation of 20×20m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell for SLAM device testing with 6-degree-of-freedom arm integration and precision servo control

**Software and Hardware Integration**
- Delivered complete system integration using NVIDIA GPUs, ROS framework, 5G networking, and AWS database with real-time web dashboard for autonomous vehicle collision detection
- Developed novel IR irradiance sensor using machine vision with Windows GUI in C++/C#/R/OpenCV, integrating hardware sensors with software control systems
- Created custom Interface Definition Language (IDL) that auto-generated APIs and embedded command-line interpreters with bidirectional gRPC streaming over TCP/IP and wireless BLE adaptors

**Production Systems and Field Testing**
- Conducted real-world validation through field deployments and comprehensive hardware testing, presenting findings at 2024 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting following collaboration with UMTRI at Mcity test track
- Successfully delivered multiple manufacturing workcells from requirements through TÜV certification and field trials using formal V-model systems engineering process

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to DeepX's autonomous heavy machinery solutions, leveraging my experience in ROS2 development, systems integration, and real-world validation. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with DeepX's mission to deliver robust autonomous solutions for heavy machinery operations.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
