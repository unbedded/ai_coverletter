RE: Software Engineer - Robotics Control Systems

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer - Robotics Control Systems role at Rapyuta Robotics. With over 20 years of experience in robotics, distributed systems, and C++ development, I bring deep expertise in multi-robot coordination, real-time control systems, and production-grade software architecture. My background spans autonomous vehicle development, manufacturing automation, and distributed intelligence systems, directly aligning with your ASRS and pick assist robot platforms. I have successfully led teams developing distributed control architectures, implemented ROS-based robotics solutions, and delivered production systems requiring multi-threading and complex algorithm design.

I am eager to support Rapyuta Robotics' mission to advance autonomous robotics through distributed intelligence. With over 20 years of experience working both in-country and remotely with Japanese engineering teams, I bring integration expertise, strong cross-cultural communication skills, and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

**C++ 11+ and Multi-threading Knowledge**
- Developed production software using modern C++17 features with CMake build systems and comprehensive testing frameworks (EXP_012). Implemented embedded C real-time software for consumer products using ARM32 controllers with multi-threaded architectures (EXP_014). Created distributed real-time control system enabling massive throughput scaling for MLCC testers from 150k/hr to 1,000k/hr (566% improvement) using advanced multi-threading patterns (EXP_018).

**ROS and Distributed Systems Experience**  
- Managed integration and operation of 20×20m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell for SLAM device testing, integrating 6-DOF arm on AMR base with precision servo control (EXP_020). Led development of Linux-based 3D collision alert system using ROS framework with NVIDIA GPUs, 5G networking, and AWS cloud integration for real-time perception and fleet deployment (EXP_001). Designed custom Interface Definition Language (IDL) with gRPC extensions supporting bidirectional streaming over TCP/IP for distributed embedded systems (EXP_006).

**Algorithm Design and Multi-agent Systems**
- Principal inventor of keystone patent for distributed real-time control system enabling scalable multi-robot coordination (US Patent 6706999B1, EXP_018). Developed vision-based alignment systems with closed-loop feedback algorithms improving manufacturing precision by 30% (EXP_019). Created convolution-based signal processing algorithms capable of operating in low signal-to-noise ratio environments with auto-generation capabilities for multiple targets (EXP_022).

**Systems Engineering and Code Reviews**
- Led several multiyear developments as lead system engineer for real-time manufacturing workcells, eliciting requirements, conducting design tradeoffs through FMEA analysis, and creating verification matrices with full traceability (EXP_026). Established Agile workflows with standardized code review processes, branching strategies, and Dockerized development environments for ROS/ROS2 projects (EXP_021). Built comprehensive documentation architecture with Interface Control Documents and single source of truth systems enabling clear decision-making (EXP_025).

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Rapyuta Robotics' distributed intelligence platform, leveraging my experience in distributed systems, ROS robotics, and multi-threading architectures and cross-cultural collaboration. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with advancing autonomous robotics in warehouse and logistics applications.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
