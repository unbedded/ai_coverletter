Rapyuta Robotics<br>
RE: Software Engineer - Robotics Control Systems

Led as Engineering Manager collision detection system field deployment across 6-van pilot fleet achieving 87.5% performance improvement (8â†’15 fps) by optimizing ROS2 node graphs, CAN decoding, and telemetry feedback loops. This real-world autonomous vehicle deployment experience directly aligns with Rapyuta's multi-robot control systems integration challenges.

With over 20 years of systems integration experience, including extensive collaboration with Japanese engineering teams, I am excited to contribute to Rapyuta Robotics' distributed intelligence mission through robust control system development and multi-robot coordination.

**C++ and Multi-Threading Proficiency with Algorithm Design Excellence**
- Staff Engineer who led 20+ years of multi-language software development with modern Agile processes, delivering production-grade C++17 systems through standardized workflows, code reviews, and comprehensive testing frameworks [1]
- Developed advanced algorithms achieving 30% improvement in end-effector accuracy through vision-based alignment systems and closed-loop feedback control for manufacturing precision
- Implemented high-performance, concurrent processing and real-time responsiveness using event-driven architectures and asynchronous programming patterns

**ROS Robotics Framework and Distributed Systems Expertise**  
- Senior Engineer who managed 20Ã—20m autonomous ROS robotic workcell with 6-DOF arm for SLAM device regression testing, integrating LQR controller with OptiTrack vision feedback for precision servo control
- Engineering Manager who led collision detection system development using ROS and FLASH LiDAR, implemented cloud connectivity via AWS for real-time data analysis, and coordinated data flows over 5G networks [2]
- Platform Engineer who built scalable multi-sensor data processing systems using cloud infrastructure, Docker, and distributed message queues while delivering production software through modern DevOps practices

**Multi-Agent Systems and Task Allocation Through Technical Leadership**
- Technical Lead who balanced project constraints, customer requirements, and market trends bringing new products to market generating $30M+ sales while managing 25-engineer team through full V-model development [3]
- System Architect who scaled MLCC tester throughput from 150k/hr to 1M/hr through distributed real-time control system design, enabling massive throughput optimization for coordinated multi-device testing
- Principal Engineer who built comprehensive communication framework from scratch with IDL-auto-generation, enabling seamless wireless control and diagnostics of distributed embedded systems [4]

**Systems Engineering and Problem-Solving with Japanese Business Context**
- Technical Consultant who supported Japanese customers nationwide for 26 years while advancing language proficiency for deeper international collaboration and team integration [5]
- Engineering Manager who achieved TÃœV certification under IEC 61010 standards through comprehensive FMEA analysis and V-model compliant safety-critical systems development over 10-year period
- Principal Developer who leveraged AI-integrated development workflow to create robust signal processing algorithms achieving 95% accuracy in challenging low SNR environments

I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Rapyuta Robotics' distributed intelligence mission, leveraging my experience in ROS robotics, distributed control systems, and multi-agent coordination alongside extensive Japanese engineering collaboration. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with advancing autonomous robotics innovation.

Sincerely,
Spencer Barrett
