### About Woven by Toyota
Woven by Toyota is enabling Toyota’s once-in-a-century transformation into a mobility company. Inspired by a legacy of innovating for the benefit of others, our mission is to challenge the current state of mobility through human-centric innovation — expanding what “mobility” means and how it serves society.

Our work centers on four pillars: AD/ADAS, our autonomous driving and advanced driver assist technologies; Arene, our software development platform for software-defined vehicles; Woven City, a test course for mobility; and Cloud & AI, the digital infrastructure powering our collaborative foundation. Business-critical functions empower these teams to execute, and together, we’re working toward one bold goal: a world with zero accidents and enhanced well-being for all.

=========================================================================

TEAM
Our team's mission is to realize Woven's vision of "Mobility for All" by developing autonomous vehicles that can operate without human involvement. We specifically focus on Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applications. MaaS offers the advantage of increased vehicle usage time through ridesharing, allowing us to equip vehicles with advanced sensors and computers necessary for achieving reliable driverless operations. We change people's lives with our driverless vehicles. While working towards our mission we aim to build a diverse team of curious and dedicated individuals with different experiences.

WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
We are looking for engineers who are passionate about making driverless vehicles come true and are excited to work with us to create a better future for mobility. Our day to day tasks include developing automated driving software, evaluating it with simulation and real vehicles, and making further improvements from real world feedback. We are looking for members who can view the numerous daily challenges as their own tasks and have the energy, advanced skills, and extensive experience to thoroughly address system performance improvement and process enhancement, as well as the ability to build strong teamwork.
