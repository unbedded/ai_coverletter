**Subject:** Application for Data Platform Software Engineer, Enterprise AI

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Data Platform Software Engineer, Enterprise AI** position. This role aligns closely with my background in distributed data pipelines, asynchronous Python development, and scalable ML infrastructure to support autonomy and perception systems.

At **PreAct Technologies (2022–2024)**, I served as Application Engineering Manager, where I led the integration of a 3D collision alert system deployed in a pilot fleet of delivery vans. My work involved real-time sensor fusion using FLASH LiDAR and cameras, post-processing using host transforms, and dataset versioning for machine learning training. I also oversaw GPU acceleration on NVIDIA Jetson platforms and data uploads via 5G cellular networks to AWS-based object storage. These pipelines handled both 2D and 3D point cloud data, converted into annotated HDF5 and JPEG formats for validation and labeling workflows.

**I exceed the MINIMUM and NICE TO HAVE QUALIFICATIONS** with over 15 years of software development experience in **Python, C++, and C#**, including asynchronous programming with `**asyncio**`, event-driven architectures with **ROS**, and containerization using **Docker**. I’ve built scalable ingestion services that process multi-sensor incident data, leveraging message queues, blob storage, and distributed cloud infrastructure. I have worked with **SQL databases**, **MongoDB**, and **Elasticsearch**, supporting storage and retrieval of large-scale ML datasets. My experience with **Docker** and familiarity with **Kubernetes** concepts and deployment workflows provide a strong foundation for this role and position me well to contribute and grow within Woven’s cloud-native infrastructure.

My recent AI research into **developer tooling** led to the creation of a fully encapsulated, AI-assisted software development environment that automatically generates production-ready Python and C++ code along with matching test cases. This is published as an **open-source** project on my GitHub: [AI SW Workflow](https://github.com/unbedded/ai_sw_workflow).

I also bring **cultural and technical familiarity with Japan**. While at ESI, I supported Japanese customers nationwide from **1992–2018** and co-led a multi-year engineering collaboration with SDK/Kyushu. This hands-on work in Japan helped me develop strong cross-cultural communication skills and a deep respect for Japanese business practices, which I look forward to building on in a Tokyo-based role.

Earlier in my career, I was part of the **Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon**, where I contributed to **Navlab 1**, one of the earliest autonomous vehicles. Most recently, I led collaboration with **UMTRI** (University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute) at Mcity’s automated vehicle test track, evaluating PreAct’s FLASH LiDAR performance under **Euro NCAP** pedestrian protocols. It is exciting to see Woven scale this vision—from Mcity’s 100-acre testbed to a real-world mobility community.

The opportunity to work in a **globally distributed, hybrid environment** and collaborate across ML, software, and cloud teams is a strong match for both my skillset and my desire to deepen cross-cultural engineering collaboration. I am actively studying Japanese and committed to becoming fluent to support long-term integration into the Tokyo-based team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
