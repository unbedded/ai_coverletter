**Subject:** Application for Senior Software Engineer, Map Services

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Senior Software Engineer, Map Services** position. This role aligns closely with my background in embedded systems, distributed data pipelines, and scalable software architectures for autonomy platforms.

At **PreAct Technologies (2022–2024)**, I served as Application Engineering Manager, where I led the integration of a Linux-based 3D perception stack deployed in a pilot fleet of delivery vans. My work involved real-time sensor fusion using ROS and FLASH LiDAR, data tagging with GPS, and GPU acceleration on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano platforms. The system integrated multiple sensors over Ethernet (UDP/IP), tapped into the high-speed CAN bus to extract vehicle signals (speed, steering, braking), and coordinated 5G-based telemetry for cloud analytics. I also managed test vehicle instrumentation and data workflows to support structured ADAS evaluation against **Euro NCAP** protocols, including **Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)** for **Vulnerable Road Users (VRU)**. These efforts included collaboration with **UMTRI** at the Mcity test track and culminated in a presentation at the **2024 TRB Annual Meeting**.

**I exceed the MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS** with deep expertise in **modern C++ (C++17)** and **Python**, extensive use of **CMake**, **Docker**, and **Git**, and a strong focus on **unit and integration testing**. My recent research led to the development of a fully encapsulated **AI-assisted development workflow** ([GitHub](https://github.com/unbedded)) designed to accelerate production-grade software delivery. I’ve led **Agile** development efforts in cross-functional teams and built internal tools that streamline **simulation**, **CI pipelines**, and **host-target integration**.

**I exceed the NICE TO HAVE qualifications** with hands-on experience across multiple domains directly relevant to this role:

- **Automotive Mapping, Navigation, and Protocols (CAN, Ethernet, SOME/IP)**: At PreAct, I integrated GPS data to geotag motion-triggered events and support ADAS validation. I also decoded high-speed CAN bus signals (e.g., speed, braking, steering) and integrated multiple sensors over Ethernet using UDP and IP protocols, supporting real-time perception and mapping infrastructure.
    
- **ARM-based SoC Architectures**: I’ve worked extensively with **NVIDIA Jetson** and **STM32F4xx ARM Cortex-M4** platforms running FreeRTOS, including secure communications using hardware encryption ([STM32 secure comms doc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-barrett-3263528/overlay/experience/762816574/multiple-media-viewer)).
    
- **Functional Safety / IEC 61010**: I’ve followed the **V-model** from safety requirements through design, FMEA, unit testing, and system-level validation. At PreAct, I contributed to systems that achieved **TÜV certification under IEC 61010**, and led safety evaluation of AEB-VRU systems using Euro NCAP-aligned testing.
    
- **Distributed, International Teams**: I’ve spent years collaborating with global teams—including frequent travel to Japan and India—leading engineering efforts and facilitating cross-cultural communication.
    
- **Business-Level Japanese**: While not yet fluent, I’m actively studying Japanese with the goal of achieving business-level proficiency to support in-country work and deepen team integration.


Earlier in my career, I contributed to **Navlab 1** at the **Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon**, one of the earliest autonomous vehicles. That experience grounded my focus on robust embedded systems, real-time simulation, and resilient architectures for autonomy—values I continue to apply in high-performance engineering environments.

The **Map Services** team’s mission to deliver scalable, high-integrity mapping infrastructure resonates strongly with my expertise and passions. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your platform and help enable the next generation of safe and intelligent mobility.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
