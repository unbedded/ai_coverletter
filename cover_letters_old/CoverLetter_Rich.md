**Subject:** Application for Lead Software Engineer, SDV Devtools | Woven by Toyota (Tokyo)

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Lead Software Engineer, SDV Devtools** position. This role aligns closely with my background in embedded systems, developer tooling, and scalable architectures for autonomy platforms.

At **PreAct Technologies (2022–2024)**, I served as Application Engineering Manager, where I led the integration of a Linux-based 3D perception stack deployed in a pilot fleet of delivery vans. My work involved real-time sensor fusion using ROS and FLASH LiDAR, data tagging with GPS, and GPU acceleration on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano platforms. The system integrated multiple sensors over Ethernet (UDP/IP), tapped into the high-speed CAN bus to extract vehicle signals (speed, steering, braking), and coordinated 5G-based telemetry for cloud analytics.

 **I exceed the MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS** with: Over a decade of experience in automotive software and sensor integration

- >3 years experience of vehicle software engineering
    
- >20 years proficiency in **Python**, **C++**, **C#,** and **bash Shell**, with extensive use of **Docker**, **Git**, and **CI/CD pipelines**
    
- Leadership of international cross-functional engineering teams and customer-facing programs
    
- Fluency in English and cultural and technical familiarity with Japan. While at ESI, I supported Japanese customers nationwide from **1992–2018** and co-led a multi-year engineering collaboration with SDK/Kyushu. This hands-on work in Japan helped me develop strong cross-cultural communication skills and a deep respect for Japanese business practices
    

**I also meet the NICE TO HAVE qualifications**, including:

- Experience **negotiating with tool vendors**: At PreAct, I negotiated and led execution of several $50k+ contracts with infrastructure vendors supporting the 3D perception stack deployed in a pilot fleet. I helped maintain cost targets, participated in weekly status reviews, and contributed directly to system testing and debugging of delivered components—ensuring robust performance and production readiness.
    
- Experience with **cloud infrastructure**: Through PreAct's deployment, I built scalable ingestion services for multi-sensor incident data using message queues, blob storage, and distributed cloud systems. I’ve worked with **SQL databases**, **MongoDB**, and **Elasticsearch**, supporting storage and retrieval of large-scale datasets.
    
- My recent AI research into **developer tooling** led to the creation of a fully encapsulated, AI-assisted software development environment that automatically generates production-ready Python and C++ code along with matching test cases. This is published as an **open-source** project on my GitHub: [AI SW Workflow]([https://github.com/unbedded/ai_sw_workflow](https://github.com/unbedded/ai_sw_workflow)).
    

Earlier in my career, I was part of the **Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon**, where I contributed to **Navlab 1**, one of the earliest autonomous vehicles. Most recently, I led collaboration with **UMTRI** (University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute) at McCity’s automated vehicle test track, evaluating PreAct’s FLASH LiDAR performance under **Euro NCAP** pedestrian protocols. It is exciting to see Woven scale this vision—from Mcity’s 100-acre testbed to a real-world mobility community.

The SDV Devtools team’s mission to empower vehicle software engineers aligns strongly with my passions. I am currently based in Oregon and open to relocation. Thank you for considering my application.
