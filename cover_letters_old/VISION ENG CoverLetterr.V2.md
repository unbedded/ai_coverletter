Hiring Committee
Computer Vision Engineer, Vision AI Platform – Inventor Garage
Woven by Toyota

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Computer Vision Engineer – Vision AI Platform role. My background combines system integration across embedded platforms, autonomous robotics, and AI-assisted software workflows, with a proven record of advancing research prototypes into fleet-ready autonomous systems. Most notably, I advanced a 3D collision-alert platform from concept through field deployment—culminating in six driverless vans operating in live service. This outcome reflects exactly the kind of cross-domain integration, performance optimization, and system validation central to Woven’s mission.

With over 20 years collaborating with Japanese engineering teams, I bring not only integration expertise but also strong cross-cultural communication skills and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. My strengths in computer vision, geometry-based algorithms, debugging complex system interactions, and fostering cross-functional collaboration make me well-prepared to contribute to the Vision AI Platform.

I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

REAL-TIME AUTONOMY AND ROBOTICS
	- PreAct Technologies – Application Engineering Manager: Advanced a Linux/ROS-based 3D collision-alert system from proof of concept to pilot fleet deployment. Developed integration plans combining FLASH LiDAR hardware, vehicle CAN-bus I/O, GNSS, DMI, and perception algorithms. Implemented 5G/AWS telemetry for fleet management. Reduced end-to-end latency, increasing frame rate from 8 -> 15 fps by balancing compute load, network throughput, and detection accuracy. Most demonstrable outcome: six driverless vans validated in live service.

	- PreAct Technologies – Application Engineering Manager: Used YOLO-based algorithms for bicycle and pedestrian detection. Algorithms were trained with FLASH LiDAR 3D image sequences to classify and predict VRU (Vulnerable Road User) entry into vehicle hazard zones.

	- SIGMA DESIGN – SLAM/ROS ROBOTICS: Managed integration and operation of a 20x20 m ROS-based robotic workcell for regression testing of 3D vision SLAM devices. Integrated a 6-DOF arm on an OTTO-100 AMR with an LQR controller and OptiTrack vision feedback for precision servo control.

	- ESI – Systems & Vision Engineer: Designed real-time control architectures that scaled throughput of MLCC testers from 150k/hr to 1M/hr. Principal inventor of the keystone patent behind ESI’s Third Dynamics laser drilling system. Principle developer of optics/hardware/C++ machine vision alignment for MLCC tester, improving end-effector accuracy by 30%.

GEOMETRY, STATISTICS, AND LINEAR ALGEBRA
	- A core part of my work history has been 3D vision applications translating raw LiDAR data to point cloud images relative to the vehicle frame of reference. This required applying geometric transformations, statistical analysis, and linear algebra techniques to generate real-time situational awareness from noisy, high-volume sensor data.

AI, GENERATIVE WORKFLOWS, AND MODERN DEVELOPMENT
	-Published the AI-Assisted Software Development Framework, applying the V-model to code generation with automatic unit test creation. Open-sourced tools that integrate LLMs into Python/C++ pipelines with Dockerized environments.
	-Developed a Linux-first open-source Morse code decoder using convolution-based filtering to extract weak signals in low SNR environments; workflow supports auto-generation of Python or C++ implementations with validation tests.
	- Extensive experience with Git, Docker, CMake, ROS/ROS 2, and AWS/GCP cloud pipelines.

COMMUNICATION AND CROSS-DOMAIN COLLABORATION
	- 20+ years collaborating with Japanese engineering teams with consensus-oriented communication aligned to Toyota’s culture.
	- At Thermo Fisher, rapidly onboarded to a $6M SEM/FIB platform with mixed legacy components. In four months, delivered a Python-based diagnostic toolchain consolidating logs from multiple subsystems, graphing KPIs, and flowcharting processes—reducing diagnostic time from days to hours. Leveraged AI to accelerate parser and dashboard development with built-in unit tests and runbooks.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Vision AI Platform, leveraging my experience in 3D computer vision, generative AI workflows, and real-time autonomy. I look forward to collaborating with Woven researchers to prototype novel vision interfaces—whether in robotics, glasses, or city infrastructure—and to publish results that advance the state of the art.
