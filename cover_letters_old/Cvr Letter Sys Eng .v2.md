RE: Systems Engineer - Driverless e-Palette

I am deeply interested in advancing the future of autonomous vehicles to improve our lives and environment. This brings my career full circle from my undergraduate work at Carnegie Mellon University's Field Robotics Center Navlab 1 (1986), one of the world's first autonomous vehicles. I am drawn to work in the Japanese culture of collective success, trust, quality, and responsibility. With over 20 years of experience working in-country and remotely, I have developed strong cross-cultural communication skills and deep respect for Japanese business practices.

Safety is central to AD/ADAS. I bring 20+ years of systems engineering using the V-model to pair each requirement with the appropriate verification: unit, subsystem, system, and vehicle tests. My work is supported by Safety Integrity Level (SIL/ASIL) targets, traceable acceptance criteria, and safety gates. I collaborate to reduce risk early using FMEA, simplify architectures, identify failure modes, specify fail-safe behaviors, and define test priorities. Objective evidence from telemetry and KPIs informs release decisions and quickly surfaces requirement conflicts.


I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:


REAL-TIME AUTONOMY AND ROBOTICS:

- PREACT TECHNOLOGIES - APPLICATION ENGINEERING MANAGER: Advanced a Linux/ROS-based 3D collision-alert system from proof of concept to pilot fleet deployment. Integrated FLASH LiDAR, vehicle CAN-bus I/O, and detection algorithms. Implemented 5G/AWS telemetry for fleet management. Reduced end-to-end latency, increasing frame rate from 8 to 15 fps.

- PREACT TECHNOLOGIES - CLIENT DEMOS AND KPIs: Designed and executed client-facing demonstrations with KPI dashboards. Advanced the delivery-van program through phase gates. Deployed 6 vehicles into beta service.

- ESI/MKS - SYSTEMS AND EMBEDDED ENGINEER: Proposed and designed a distributed real-time control system enabling next-generation MLCC testers to scale from 150k/hr to 1,000k/hr. Principal inventor of the keystone patent behind ESI's Third Dynamics laser drilling system [4].


VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION (TEST DESIGN TO EXECUTION):

- Built the system test strategy, executed software-in-the-loop (SiL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL), defined acceptance criteria and safety gates, and instrumented KPIs and telemetry for objective evidence. This drove earlier defect detection and faster triage.

- AEB/VRU SYSTEM-LEVEL TESTING: Lead architect and data analyst evaluating PreAct's LiDAR for Autonomous Emergency Braking in Vulnerable Road User scenarios against Euro NCAP protocols. With UMTRI at Mcity, designed and executed controlled tests; findings presented at the 2024 TRB Annual Meeting. Results showed successful VRU detection within 8 meters of potential collision, including pedestrian/cyclist, day/night, and speeds up to 40 km/h.

- SAFETY COMPLIANCE AND CERTIFICATION: Led testing and system upgrades to pass EN-61010 and TUV certification for a 30x30 m autonomous ROS robotic workcell and for ESI/MKS's MLCC testing workcell. Resolved hazardous voltage exposure and excessive emissions, achieving certification.


SYSTEMS ENGINEERING V-MODEL:

- ESI: As lead system engineer, led several ground-up multiyear developments of real-time electronic component manufacturing workcells. Elicited customer requirements, wrote system requirements, supported design tradeoffs to reduce risk uncovered in FMEA. Verification matrix provided traceability of requirements through test. Supported and executed acceptance tests from subsystem through TUV certification and field trials.

- OPEN SOURCE: Published "AI Assisted SW Development Framework," applying the V-process model to software development. It translates high-level requirements into production-ready code paired with unit tests [1]. Also principal inventor on a novel safety test instrument that followed the V-model [5].


C++/PYTHON/LINUX AND MODERN DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES:

- Delivered software components on Linux (ROS/ROS 2, Jetson/Drive). Established Agile workflows that decompose Jira epics into testable tasks paired with unit tests. Standardized code review, branching, artifact versioning, and Dockerized environments.

- Strong C++ and Python skills. Created an AI-assisted development environment emphasizing testing [1], [2].

- OPEN SOURCE: Developed a Linux-first open-source Morse code decoder integrating AI into the workflow. Designed a convolution-based filter technique able to decode in low SNR environments. Can auto-generate Python or C++ targets with validation tests [6].


COMMUNICATION:

- Built and maintained ICDs, requirement notes, and decision memos. Led fact-based triage using logs and timestamps. Partnered with PM and Service Ops for clear release notes and field feedback.

- Established a baseline single source of truth in Confluence, with clear subsystem specs and test reports. Organized requirements into must-haves and nice-to-haves for clear cost/benefit tradeoffs.

- 20+ years collaborating with Japanese teams with consensus-oriented communication aligned with Toyota's culture.

- At Thermo Fisher, rapidly onboarded to a $6M SEM/FIB platform with mixed legacy components. In four months delivered a Python-based diagnostic toolchain consolidating logs from multiple subsystems, graphing KPIs, and flowcharting processes. Reduced time-to-diagnose from days to hours.

- Leveraged AI to accelerate development of log parsers and dashboards with unit tests and runbooks, enabling faster onboarding.


I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Driverless e-Palette project, leveraging my experience in systems engineering, real-time autonomy, and cross-cultural collaboration. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with Toyota's vision for autonomous vehicles.
