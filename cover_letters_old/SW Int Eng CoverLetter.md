Software Integration Engineer, Driverless e-Palette
Woven by Toyota

RE: Software Integration Engineer - Driverless e-Palette

I am excited to apply for the Software Integration Engineer role on Woven by Toyota’s Driverless e-Palette team. My background combines system integration across embedded platforms, autonomous robotics, and real-time software, with a proven record of delivering fleet-ready autonomous systems. Most notably, I advanced a 3D collision-alert platform from concept through field deployment—culminating in six driverless vans operating in live service. This outcome reflects exactly the kind of cross-domain integration, performance optimization, and system validation central to Woven’s mission.

I am eager to support Woven’s mission to deliver safe and reliable autonomous mobility. With over 20 years of experience working both in-country and remotely with Japanese engineering teams, I bring integration expertise, strong cross-cultural communication skills, and a deep respect for Japanese business practices. My strengths in debugging complex system interactions, conducting statistical performance analysis, and fostering cross-functional collaboration make me well-prepared to contribute to the integration challenges of the Driverless e-Palette program.

I exceed the minimum and nice-to-have qualifications with the following experience:

REAL-TIME AUTONOMY AND ROBOTICS:

	- PREACT TECHNOLOGIES – APPLICATION ENGINEERING MANAGER: Advanced a Linux/ROS-based 3D collision-alert system from proof of concept to pilot fleet deployment. Developed and executed integration plans combining in-house FLASH LiDAR hardware, vehicle CAN-bus I/O, GNSS, DMI, and perception algorithms. Implemented 5G/AWS telemetry for fleet management and tapped into high-speed CAN bus to decode vehicle dynamics (speed, braking, etc.). Reduced end-to-end latency, increasing frame rate from 8 to 15 fps by balancing compute load, network throughput, and detection accuracy. Most demonstrable outcome: successfully deployed six driverless vans into in-service field testing, validating the system under real operational conditions.

	- ESI – SYSTEMS & EMBEDDED ENGINEER: Proposed and designed a distributed real-time control system enabling next-generation MLCC testers to scale throughput from 150k/hr to 1,000k/hr. Served as principal inventor of the keystone patent behind ESI’s Third Dynamics™ laser drilling system.

	- ESI – VISION ENGINEER: Contributed for 15+ years to C++ machine vision projects for target alignment and closed-loop feedback. Proposed and developed a vision-based alignment feedback system that improved MLCC tester end-effector accuracy by 30%. Built expertise in algorithms, optical sensors, and lighting integration.

	- SIGMA DESIGN – SLAM/ROS ROBOTICS: Managed integration and operation of a 20×20 m autonomous ROS-based robotic workcell for regression testing of 3D vision SLAM devices. Integrated a 6-degree-of-freedom arm on an OTTO-100 AMR base with an LQR controller using OptiTrack vision feedback for precision servo control and repeatable trajectory delivery.


C++/PYTHON/LINUX AND MODERN DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES:

	- PREACT TECHNOLOGIES: Delivered software components on Linux (ROS/ROS 2, Jetson/Drive). Established Agile workflows that decompose Jira epics into testable tasks paired with unit tests. Standardized code review, branching, artifact versioning, and Dockerized environments. Build systems were based on Cmake toolset.

		- OPEN SOURCE: Strong C++ and Python skills. Published "AI Assisted SW Development Framework," applying the V-process model to software development. It translates high-level requirements into production-ready code paired with unit tests [1].  Policy templates define the coding, documentation, and unit test standards the AI executes. 

	- OPEN SOURCE: Developed a Linux-first open-source Morse code decoder integrating AI into the workflow. Designed a convolution-based filter technique able to decode in low SNR environments. Can auto-generate Python or C++ targets with validation tests [6].


COMMUNICATION:

	- 20+ years collaborating with Japanese teams with consensus-oriented communication aligned with Toyota's culture.

	- At Thermo Fisher, rapidly onboarded to a $6M SEM/FIB platform with mixed legacy components. In four months delivered a Python-based diagnostic toolchain consolidating logs from multiple subsystems, graphing KPIs, and flowcharting processes. Reduced diagnostic time from days to hours. Leveraged AI to accelerate development of log parsers and dashboards with unit tests and runbooks, enabling faster onboarding.


I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Driverless e-Palette project, leveraging my experience in software/systems engineering, real-time autonomy, and cross-cultural collaboration. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with Toyota’`'s vision for autonomous vehicles.
