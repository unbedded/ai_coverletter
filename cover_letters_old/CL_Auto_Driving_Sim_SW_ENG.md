**Subject: Application for Autonomous Driving Simulation Software Engineer – Arene Reactor | Woven by Toyota (Tokyo)**

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the AUTONOMOUS DRIVING SIMULATION SOFTWARE ENGINEER – ARENE REACTOR position at Woven by Toyota in Tokyo. This role aligns with my background in real-time simulation, embedded systems, and scalable autonomy software.

At PREACT TECHNOLOGIES (2022–2024), I served as Application Engineering Manager, taking over a Linux-based 3D collision alert system following its initial proof of concept and advancing it through integration and field deployment in a pilot fleet of delivery vans. I managed sensor integration using ROS and FLASH LiDAR, implemented cloud connectivity via AWS for real-time data analysis, and contributed embedded programming and GPU acceleration on NVIDIA platforms. I also coordinated data flows over 5G—closely reflecting the requirements of this role. I served as a lead for sensor and test vehicle design, operation, and data analysis to evaluate PreAct’s LiDAR in AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING (AEB) for VULNERABLE ROAD USER (VRU) scenarios. This work included developing formal test procedures based on EURO NCAP pedestrian protocols. In collaboration with UMTRI, I supported controlled testing at Mcity’s automated vehicle test track. Findings were presented at the 2024 TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD (TRB) ANNUAL MEETING.

I EXCEED THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS, with strong proficiency in both C++ AND PYTHON, and a proven track record of building MODULAR, PRODUCTION-QUALITY SOFTWARE [1]. I am also a firm believer in UNIT AND END-TO-END TESTING, having implemented robust test frameworks throughout my career. My recent AI research led to the creation of a fully encapsulated AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT that emphasizes this workflow [2]. I’ve worked cross-functionally with QA, product managers, and application developers in agile teams to deliver production software. Additionally, I’ve used DOCKER AND GIT extensively for development, CI/CD automation, and deployment.

In addition to the core qualifications, I bring hands-on experience with many of the "NICE TO HAVE" SKILLS listed in the posting. MY WORK AT PREACT GAVE ME EXPERIENCE WITH OPENGL AND POINT CLOUD VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES for our LIDAR sensor viewer. I also designed and implemented a custom INTERFACE DEFINITION LANGUAGE (IDL) that auto-generated an API, embedded command-line interpreter, and host-side Python interface for unit testing and host-target communication over PROTOCOL BUFFERS. As a hobby project, I extended this system to support GRPC WITH BLE ADAPTORS, enabling wireless control and diagnostics of embedded systems. This work included BIDIRECTIONAL GRPC STREAMING OVER TCP/IP, directly applicable to Woven’s focus on simulation infrastructure, API design, and distributed systems communication.

I also bring CULTURAL AND TECHNICAL FAMILIARITY WITH JAPAN. While at ESI, I supported Japanese customers nationwide from 1992–2018 and co-led a multi-year engineering collaboration with SDK/Kyushu. This hands-on work in Japan helped me develop strong cross-cultural communication skills and a deep respect for Japanese business practices, which I look forward to building on in a Tokyo-based role.

Earlier in my career, I was part of the FIELD ROBOTICS CENTER AT CARNEGIE MELLON, where I contributed to NAVLAB 1, one of the earliest autonomous vehicles. This foundational experience gave me lasting insight into real-time robotics control, embedded systems, and simulation—skills that continue to inform my work today.

Woven by Toyota’s vision—especially the Arene Reactor’s mission to accelerate software deployment through simulation—aligns with my passion for developing robust tools that enable safer, smarter mobility. I’m eager to bring my simulation, systems, and embedded software expertise to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Woven’s next-generation software-defined vehicle stack.

Best regards,

**Subject:** Application for Autonomous Driving Simulation Software Engineer – Arene Reactor | Woven by Toyota (Tokyo)

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Autonomous Driving Simulation Software Engineer – Arene Reactor** position at Woven by Toyota in Tokyo. This role aligns with my background in real-time simulation, embedded systems, and scalable autonomy software.

At **PreAct Technologies (2022–2024)**, I served as Application Engineering Manager, taking over a Linux-based 3D collision alert system following its _initial proof of concept_ and advancing it through integration and field deployment in a pilot fleet of delivery vans.
